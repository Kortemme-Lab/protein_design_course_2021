    "# ΔΔG Exercise\n",
    "\n",
    "A classical technique in protein biochemisty and protein engineering is to describe a mutant protein sequence in terms of a \"ΔΔG\": the change in free energy of a protein upon mutation. This formalism has been especially useful in many applications, such as identifying stabilizing mutations for industrial protein engineering applications, or identifying \"hot spot\" residues in protein-protein interaction interfaces that contribute most of the energy to binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computing changes of free energy is at the core of the design functionality in Rosetta, since we undergo a design simulation by choosing mutations (sampling) and seeing whether they improve the predicted energy of the structure (scoring). In this exercise, we will see how close we can get with predicting the ΔΔG of mutations in a well-studied monomeric protein, lysozyme. We will try to compute a ΔΔG in a couple of ways, and at each step compare the predictions with the experimentally measured ΔΔG.\n",
