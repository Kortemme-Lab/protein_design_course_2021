## Zoom
Zoom is our video conferencing app, where we will meet for our daily lecture, discussions, and for introducing the practical exercises.
- Zoom ID: 9772480758

## Gather
Gather is a video-calling app for your browser or desktop that provides a workspace for entering and exiting individual or group conversations, initiated by walking around a virtual floorplan with an avatar. TAs will be on Gather to field questions on the practical exercises during course hours.

## Slack
Slack is a messaging app for your browser or desktop. You should have received an invite to the workplace from the TAs. We hope you find Slack useful for co-ordinating the group project work. If you'd like to reach the TAs outside of course hours, they will do their best to respond to pings on Slack in a timely fashion!
